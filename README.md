Using open weather API to prove that its hot at the equator.
Analysis: 

Observed Trend 1: Temperature is highest near the equator.Some more interesting notes is that there are not as many locations past the latitude of -50, which is south of the equator, as there are North fo the equator. But the general trend is an upside down parabola in shape. With the highest points at the equator and the lowest closest to the north. Perhaps partially the reason for this could be that it is winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere, so it should be generally warmer for the Southern hemisphere.
Observed Trend 2: Cloudiness really has no meaning with latitude.Nor does humidity.
Observed Trend 3: Wind seems to have higher speeds in higher latitudes. With the lowest wind speeds being close to -10 latitude. 


In my next analysis. I would say a better way to prove would be to get averages of each location for a year. This would probably be my next research. I would also like to see how cloudiness, humidity might be different if I used longtiude instead of latitude.
